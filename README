Exploring native client with a 2D context.

To build, there are two lines at the top of the Makefile that need
to be changed.  That should be it.

NACLPORTS_ROOT = /home/derek/dev/naclports/src
NACL_SDK_ROOT = ~/dev/nacl_sdk

where ~dev/nacl_sdk a symlink to native_client_sdk_0_1_507_0/

That SDK is pretty old, so the project includes some recent source
from SVN to enable key events with pepper 1. (I think). :)

$ make 
$ python httpd.py
$ chrome --enable-nacl

httpd.py will emit an address like localhost:5103
click the pepper_plugin.html
